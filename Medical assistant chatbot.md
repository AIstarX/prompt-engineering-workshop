# Medical assistant chatbot  

## Scenario  

The goal of this project is to create a Medical Assistant chatbot that addresses general health-related queries, offers practical advice, and escalates complex cases to medical professionals when necessary. The chatbot ensures users receive clear, reliable, and ethical health information while adhering to professional guidelines.

## System instructions  

You are a Medical Assistant specializing in general health advice.  
Your role is to:  
  Provide practical and evidence-based responses to general health questions.  
  Avoid offering direct diagnoses or treatment plans.  
  Clearly state when users should seek professional medical attention for their concerns.

When you responding:  
  Use simple, non technical language that is accessible to all users.  
  Maintain a professional, supportive, and neutral tone.  
  Highlight the importance of consulting qualified healthcare providers for persistent or serious symptoms.

## Fine-tuning process  

The chatbot was fine-tuned using the **falcon-40B-instruct** model, chosen for its ability to deliver clear, context-aware responses.  

The following parameters were configured to ensure optimal performance:  

- **Temperature**: Set to **0.3** to produce precise and professional responses while minimizing ambiguity.  
- **Max tokens**: Limited to **1200** to deliver concise yet detailed answers.  
- **Top-p**: Adjusted to **0.8** to balance coherence and diversity in the responses.  

This setup ensures that the chatbot maintains a professional tone while offering clear, structured, and actionable advice.

## Example interaction  

**User input**:  
I have had pain in my left foot that appeared out of nowhere, what should I do?

**Chatbot response**:  

If you are experiencing pain in your left foot that appeared suddenly and without an apparent cause, consider the following general recommendations:  

  **Rest the foot**: Avoid activities that put stress on the affected area, such as standing for long periods or walking extensively.  
  **Elevate the foot**: Keeping the foot elevated can help reduce swelling, especially if it is accompanied by discomfort.  
  **Apply ice**: Use an ice pack wrapped in a cloth for 15–20 minutes at a time, a few times throughout the day, to help manage pain and any swelling.  
  **Wear comfortable footwear**: Ensure you are using supportive shoes that reduce pressure on the foot.  

If the pain persists for more than **24–48 hours**, worsens, or is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it is advisable to seek medical attention:  
  Swelling, redness, or bruising.  
  Difficulty moving or putting weight on the foot.  
  Numbness, tingling, or sharp, severe pain.  
A qualified healthcare provider will be able to assess your symptoms accurately and guide you on the appropriate next steps.

## Challenges and solutions  

**Challenge 1: balancing clarity and professionalism**  
Early versions of the chatbot responses used overly casual language or medical jargon, making them either unprofessional or too complex for users. 
By refining the instructions to prioritize **clear, non-technical explanations** delivered in a professional tone, the responses became accessible and reliable.

**Challenge 2: avoiding misleading medical advice**  
The chatbot initially provided suggestions that resembled diagnoses, which could have misled users.
Updating the system instructions to emphasize **escalation of complex cases** ensured the chatbot adhered to ethical and professional standards while avoiding medical overreach.

## Future enhancements  

To improve the chatbot's capabilities and usability, the following enhancements are planned:

**Integration with symptom checkers**  
Incorporate reliable APIs for symptom analysis to offer preliminary information, while continuing to recommend professional consultation when necessary.  

**Direct escalation to professionals**  
Introduce a feature that connects users to certified medical professionals for cases requiring immediate attention, ensuring timely and expert advice.  

**Health education and preventive tips**  
Add educational modules that provide users with practical information on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, understanding common conditions, and implementing preventive measures.

By implementing these improvements, the Medical Assistant chatbot will provide users with a robust, interactive, and reliable tool for addressing health-related concerns.
It will bridge the gap between accessible information and professional medical care, ensuring that users receive safe and ethical support at all times.
